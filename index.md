  <h1>Hi, I'm Gyujin Hong!</h1>
  <p>Junior Machine Learning Engineer</p>
  <p>I love developing and learning from machine learning and data science projects that solve real-world problems.
  <p>I have experience working at a AI/automotive startup in Carlsbad, California as a machine learning engineer for about 2 years and 7 months, including one year of software engineer internship. I was part of  R&D side for AI implementation and opimization/implementation on the Eye-Tracking&Detection team, and have experience with Detectrons, YOLO, and HuggingFace. I was one of two AI Engineer reps for SW/HW meetings with international investor/partners from France, Germany, Japan, Korea and Detroit, and attended CES 2025 through this experience, gaining precious exposure and deeper passion for the future of AI.
