  <p>Junior Machine Learning Engineer</p>
  <p>I love developing and learning with machine learning and data science projects that solve real-world problems.
  <p>I have experience working as a Machine Learning Engineer at a AR/VR Heads-up Display startup in Carlsbad, California for about 3 years. I mainly worked with Python - Pytorch, Tensorflow, and Opencv to build and train models, and C++ for deployment in a Linux environment with Docker containerization.</p>
    
  <p>I was part of  R&D side for ML implementation and optimization/implementation on the Eye-Tracking & Detection team, and have experience with Detectrons, YOLO, and HuggingFace. Most of my experience included managing / training database for our eyetrack modules, building, training, and fine-tuning AI models, conducting experiments to test performance of models, and analyzing and visualizing the experiment data to organize results and compare performance levels. 
  I was one of two AI/ML Engineer reps for SW/HW meetings with international investor/partners from France, Germany, Japan, and Detroit, and attended CES 2025, gaining precious exposure within the industry and deeper passion for the future of AI and data engineering.</p>
